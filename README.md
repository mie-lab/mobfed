# Linked Mobility Feed Specification MOBFED 🚗🚋✈️🚴🚶🚕🛥🚌🚊🛳🚀🚇 ...
The Linked Mobility Feed (MOBFED) specification provides a set of Linked Data classes and properties that can be used to communicate mobility offers. It's primary design goals are:

- The inclusion of all current and (near-future) modes of transport.
- The possibility to update individual transport offers in real-time.
- Its use within integrated mobility planners.

The MOBFED specification is inspired by Linked Data GTFS, whose definition can be found under:
